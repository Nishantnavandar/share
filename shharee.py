#stock_news_app.py
#
# This file has been edited to remove all code that depends on
# external libraries (like streamlit, pandas, newsapi, etc.)
# as requested.
#
# As a result, the application no longer has a user interface
# or any of its core features (news, stock lists, sentiment).
#
# This demonstrates that the features you want *require*
# those libraries to be installed.

# The 'datetime' library is built-in to Python,
# so we can keep the code that uses it.
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# --- 3. DATE HELPER FUNCTIONS ---
# This is the only part of the original code that does not
# require an external library to be installed.

def get_date_range(period_name):
    """
    Returns a (from_date, to_date) tuple in ISO format (YYYY-MM-DD)
    based on the period name.
    """
    today = datetime.now()
    
    if period_name == "last_week":
        from_date = today - timedelta(days=7)

    return from_date.strftime("%Y-%m-%d"), today.strftime("%Y-m-%d")

# --- All other functions were removed ---
#
# - All 'import streamlit' and st.xxx code was removed
#   (This removes the web application UI).
#
# - All 'import nsetools' and 'import pandas' code was removed
#   (This removes the ability to get stock lists).
#
# - All 'import newsapi' code was removed
#   (This removes the ability to fetch news).
#
# - All 'import vaderSentiment' code was removed
#   (This removes the sentiment analysis).

# We can create a simple print-out to show the one
# remaining function.
